\section{Summary}

$\; \; \;$ In this lab I learned the basic functions of the Snopsys custom design tools. I drew a custom inverter layout with PMOS and NMOS transistors using 90nm technologies. I completed tasks including shcematic design, layout, and simulation of design. I learned to perform transient and DC analysis from the inputs and outputs that I specified in my circuit schematic. Beyond that, I learned to perform different measurements including a delay measurement annotated waveform, a rise/fall measurement annotated waveform, an average measurement annotated waveform, and a frequency measurement annotated waveform.

\section{Problems encountered}

$\; \; \; $Some of the issues that I ran into while completing this lab were related to finding files and starting where I left off. During the initial lab section I created a schematic and did not save it properly so I was not able to recover it when I logged on again. I ended up just recreating the schematic. I also sometimes had problems with determining whether or not an instruction from the GitHub was based on a wire I placed by myself or a naming convention. I worked those issues out via trial and error.
